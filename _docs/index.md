This site aims to be a comprehensive guide to Magallanes. We’ll cover topics such
as getting your site up and running, deploying to various environments, 

and give you some advice on participating in the future
development of Magallanes itself.

## So what is Magallanes, exactly?

Magallanes is a deployment tool for PHP applications. It's quite simple to use and manage.
It will get your application to a safe harbor.
You can instruct Magallanes to deploy your code to all the servers you want (eg: rsync over ssh),
and run tasks for that freshly deployed code.
